# cheatsheet: Machine Learning Model Templates

This repository contains a collection of templates for basic machine learning models.
The aim is to provide easy-to-use and customizable templates that can be quickly adapted for
various machine learning tasks.

## Contents
- **Data Preprocessing Tools**: A Jupyter notebook with essential tools and functions for data
  preprocessing. This includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering techniques.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: A Jupyter notebook template for implementing and understanding
  simple linear regression models.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: A Jupyter notebook template for implementing and understanding
  multiple linear regression models.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cheatsheet.git
2. **Navigate to the Desired Notebook**:
    Open the notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
    Customize the templates according to your data and requirements.
3. **Run the Code**:
Each notebook contains code cells that can be executed sequentially.
Modify the code as needed for your specific use case.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, you will need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```
## Contrubuting
Contributions are welcome! If you have templates for other models or improvements to existing
ones, feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue.
